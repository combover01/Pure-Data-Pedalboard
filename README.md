# Pure-Data-Pedalboard

Making random pedals for use as live effects in Pure Data. I will add some documentation on how to use each pedal once I get some pedal presets made and added.

## Pedals with documentation:


## Pedals without documentation (download the whole folder and wiggle some sliders):
Overdrive

Ring Modulator / Tremolo

Delay (good luck, big changes coming soon)
